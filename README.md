#last portfolio

A BCS asignment, was asked to use my existing portfolio with just plain html and css and turned that code in to a react app.
was able to produce one  basic about page with cantact info and links to linked in and git hub. 
was not able to display image or the navbar without breking the code, everything else work fine.
