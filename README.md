#last portfolio

A BCS asignment, was asked to use my existing portfolio with just plain html and css and turned that code in to a react app.
was able to produce one  basic about page with cantact info and links to linked in and git hub. 
when testing the page and runing npm start two windows open insted of just one.
also switch router method is broken in aplication the code is perfect to my knowledge.
did several rebuilds without success.
was not able to display image or the navbar without breking the code, everything else work fine. 
dont know if the case may be deployement code is breaking my code
